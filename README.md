# lm-web-framework

lm-web-framework is a web framework used for my personal projects. It is 
designed to be simple to use and very small in size.

In regards to server configuration, the only requirement is to prevent public
access to the private folder at the root of the framework folder.

The framework files are organised as below:

 * private/: contains the files which must not be accessible by visitors
 directly.
     * classes/: contains the classes of the project
         * LM/
             * WebFramework/: classes part of the framework
                 * Controller/: the IController interface
                 * View/: the IView interface
                 * Router.php: the Router class
             * Other utility classes…
 * public/:
    * index.php: the main controller of the framework. It's a script and its 
    specific name and path makes it able to handle all requests related to the
    website. It defines constants, includes and registers the auto-loader, and
    calls the right method on the controller (retrieved via a Router object).

A number of modifications could be made in the future.
 * First, "Controller" could be later changed for "PageController", as it is less
ambiguous and avoids confusion between a page controller and the main
controller.
 * The Router class could be moved to a specific namespace and implement an
interface, e.g. IRouter.
 * The Router needs to read the routes from something like a JSON file.
 * The main controller, index.php, poses a number of issues. It does not have
 a namespace yet it is part of the framework. The URLs of the requests it can
 handle show get parameters in their native form, which is not desirable.
 Ultimately, server configuration will be necessary to ensure URLs are displayed
 properly and that the main controller can be located and named in a way more
 consistent with the rest of the framework's files.
 * PHP documentation needs to be applied and package names need to be
 determined.
 * Strict typing.
 * Wrap request infomation into immutable object?
 * Hungarian notation?
 * Implement view inheritance system?
 * Dependency injection
All the code the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4.
